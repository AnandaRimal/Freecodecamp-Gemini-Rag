      "*   **Locator**: This tool assigns specific memory addresses where segments of the object code will be loaded. It commonly converts `.exe` files into `.bin` files. An example of a locator program is EXE2BIN.\n",
      "*   **Debugger**: A debugger is used to load your object code program into system memory, execute it, and troubleshoot issues. It enables you to inspect the contents of registers and memory locations during and after program execution, and also allows setting breakpoints to pause execution at specific points.\n",
      "*   **Emulator**: An emulator combines hardware and software to test and debug the hardware and software of external systems, such as microprocessor-based prototypes.\n",
